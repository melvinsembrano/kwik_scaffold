Description:
    Generates  controller, its seven RESTful actions and related
    views. Pass the model name, either CamelCased or under_scored. The
    controller name is retrieved as a pluralized version of the model name.

    To create a controller within a module, specify the model name as a
    path like 'parent_module/controller_name'.

    This generates a controller class in app/controllers.

Example:
    `bin/rails generate scaffold_plus:controller User name:string age:integer`

    User controller with URLs like /users.
        Controller: app/controllers/users_controller.rb
        Test:       test/controllers/users_controller_test.rb
